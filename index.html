<H1>Four House Republicans Can Save US Biomedical Research</H1>
<p>If any politician brought into their community the amount of economic activity and jobs generated by federally funded biomedical research, the electorate would hear about it until the end of their political career. If any politician <b>removed from</b> their community the amount of economic activity and jobs generated by federally funded biomedical research, <b>that politician</b> should hear about it until the end of their political career...which could be as soon as January 2027.</p>

<H2>The Situation</H2>
<p>The future of biomedical research in the United States, and therefore the world, is at stake this September as Congress passes the Federal Fiscal Year 2026 Budget. The Trump Administration has proposed existential cuts to the NIH and therefore all biomedical research in the US. These budget cuts, and administrative moves to politicize science, will cost lives, lead to disability, and diminish American power. Beyond harming human health, these cuts will also have a devastating economic impact on communities nationwide. The Senate has recognized the danger posed by these cuts and rebuked the Trump Administration's proposal. In order to preserve American biomedical preeminence and avoid economic devastation, support in the House of Representatives is crucial.</p>

<H2>The Path Forward</H2>
<p>If the current composition of the House holds through the budget process, then all Democratic Representatives and <b>FOUR Republican Representatives</b> can stop these devastating cuts and save US biomedical research. The default view of the table below represents the Republican House members most in danger of losing their seats in the 2026 midterm elections. The table combines the excellent work of <a href="https://scienceimpacts.org/fy26">SCIMap</a> estimates of the economic impact of these budget cuts on Congressional districts, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections">2024 House election results</a>, and the <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives">House directory</a> contact number for representatives. The economic impact estimate takes into account the multiplicative impact of NIH funding, $1 of NIH funding results in $2.56 of economic activity. The economic impact estimate also calculates the "ripple effect" of the economic impact from the location of the receiving institution to surrounding communities. The table is default filtered for Republican representatives who won their district by 54% or less of the vote and is sorted by economic impact.</p>
