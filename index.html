  <title>Stop FY26 NIH Budget Cuts</title>

  <h1>Save US Biomedical Research and Your Local Economy</h1>
  <p>The US Congress will determine the FY26 Federal Budget this
    September. The Trump Administration has proposed devastating cuts to the
    National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest funding source of all
    biomedical research globally. In addition to supporting all human
    health, NIH funding fuels local economies throughout the US. Every $1 of
    NIH funding generates $2.56 of economic activity in the communities
    surrounding the institutions receiving the funding.</p>
  <p>The US Senate has already signaled a strong, bipartisan rebuke of the
    proposed cuts. Just <strong>FOUR House Republicans</strong> joining
    House Democrats will stop these devastating cuts. These Republican House
    Members won their seats with less than 52% of their districts vote in
    2024. Each of these House Members will lose tens to hundreds of millions
    of dollars for their districts. If you are represented by one of these
    House Members, you are currently the most powerful ally for biomedical
    research in the US.</p>
