The table combines the excellent work of SCIMap estimates of the economic impact of these budget cuts on Congressional districts, the 2024 House election results, and the US House of Representatives directory contact number for representatives. The economic impact estimate takes into account the multiplicative impact of NIH funding, $1 of NIH funding results in $2.56 of economic activity. The economic impact estimate also calculates the "ripple effect" of the economic impact from the location of the receiving institution to surrounding communities.
